# Random Vehicle Data Generator!
![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/random_number.png)

This is the Random Vehicle Data Generator.

We've deviced a not so cool random vehicle data generator for you to use as a base. It basically read out `.csv` data that is located on `/meta` and broadcast out each row in `nats`.

In case you're wondering what `nats` is, It is a really hot new sofware that we use to do message broadcasting in a pub-sub model. 

While you're reading the code, you'll find 2 interesting question for you to answer in your presentation if you're up for it.

Happy Coding!
